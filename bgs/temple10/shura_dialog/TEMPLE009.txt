TEMPLE09:
-INTRO-

Shiryu:
There you are knight! Why didn't you fight us inside your temple?

shura:
I am Shura, Golden Knight of Capricorn! I am Athena's most trusted servant!

shura:
Do you really think I would have taken the risk of dirtying the statue of Athena inside my temple?

Shiryu:
How can you say such nonsense! Saori Kido is the reincarnation of Athena! You have the wrong enemy, we are trying to save her!

shura:
You are usurpers with your false Athena! You deserve death for speaking such blasphemies!

END OF LEVEL

Shiryu:
You leave me no choice, the only way to defeat you is to use the Forbidden Ultimate Dragon Technique!

shura:
The ultimate dragon technique? This is ridiculous, are you going to sacrifice yourself to beat me?

Shiryu:
Yes I told you so... I can die in this fight... but know one thing... a dragon never dies alone!!
