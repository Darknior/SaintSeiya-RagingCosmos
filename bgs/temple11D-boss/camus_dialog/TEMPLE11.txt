TEMPLE11:
-INTRO-

Hyoga:
I am honored to see you again my master, Camus, knight of Aquarius!

Camus:
Poor fool, you should have stayed inside your ice coffin!

Hyoga:
Thanks to my friends, that's no longer the case. Know that I want to thank you for the techniques that you taught me during our previous fights.

Camus:
Alright, between us Hyoga! This time I will fight with all my might!!

-END OF FIGHT-

Camus:
This time it's the end, I'm going to use my ultimate ice technique, the one that reaches the coldest temperature in the universe, absolute zero!

Camus:
Execution Aurora!!

Hyoga:
.....

Camus:
Congratulations Hyoga, you managed to use absolute zero, I have nothing more to teach you, you have exceeded your master...

Hyoga:
Thank you my master... for all you have done for me...
