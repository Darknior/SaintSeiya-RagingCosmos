TEMPLE07:
-INTRO-

Milo:
Welcome Bronze Knight!

Hyoga:
You are Milo, the Golden Knight of the Scorpion aren't you? Let us pass we must reach the room of the great Pope!

Milo:
If you believe that I will let you cross and you have the slightest chance of beating me, you are dreaming Hyoga of the swan!

Hyoga:
No one has to tell me that I shouldn't believe in my dreams if that's the case! Only a loser without convictions can believe such a thing!

END OF FIGHT

Milo:
You will die Hyoga! No one has been able to survive multiple scorpion stings so far; May the needle of Antares bring you down!

Hyoga:
Diamond dust!!

Milo:
What? He managed to hit all my vital points! Without the specific resistance of my armor I would be dead...

Milo:
Very well, you have proven your bravery and your honor as a knight, I agree to let you pass Hyoga, go join your friends...
