TEMPLE07:
-INTRO-

Shiryu:
Here we are in the house of the balance, the temple of my old master Dohko; what is that?

Shiryu:
It's a coffin of ice! Look, Hyoga is inside; he is alive I still barely perceive his cosmos!!

Shiryu:
I understand, Hyoga lost his fight, against his master Camus, the golden knight of Aquarius who locked him inside

Shiryu:
We must successfully break this ice in less than 60 seconds if we want to save Hyoga before he dies!


Hyoga:
Ghhh... You saved me... Thank you...
