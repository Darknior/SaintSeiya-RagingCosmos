TEMPLE06:

-INTRO-

Shaka:
How dare you disturb my meditation?

Ikki:
You are the golden knight of the virgin Shaka, the one who claims to be closest to the gods?

Shaka:
Right, and you're Ikki the phoenix knight, right? I will punish your arrogance and send you to hell!

Ikki:
It doesn't bother me, quite the contrary! Hell I go there very often!

END OF FIGHT

Shaka:
It's time to put an end to this phoenix fight! Get ready to receive the treasure of heaven!!

Ikki:
My body! What is happening? I can not move anymore!

Shaka:
The treasure of heaven is a destructive technique that I use to deprive my victim of his 5 senses, one after the other!

Ikki:
Aarghhh!!!
